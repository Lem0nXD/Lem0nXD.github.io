October 26, 2017</p>
<img class="ScreamFortress2" src="ScreamFortress.jpg">
<p class="ScreamFortress">Play your favorite classic Scream Fortress maps alongside Jungle Inferno! We've<br>
added free Halloween contracts and rewards to the ConTracker! Scream Fortress IX<br>
runs through November 8, 2017.</p>
<p class="ScreamFortress"><span class="pyro">Jungle Inferno is Live!</span><br>
October 20, 2017</p>
<img class="ScreamFortress2" src="jungle_inferno_blog.jpg">
<p class="ScreamFortress">You read that right! (Unless you read "live" in its "lɪv" verb form instead of its "laɪv"<br>
adjective form, in which case you didn't actually read that right.) The Jungle Inferno<br>
Update is live! The Jungle Inferno Campaign! New Pyro weapons! War Paint! Cases!<br>
Taunts! It's all here, and it's all in-game and ready to play! See you there!<br>
</p>
<p class="ScreamFortress"><span class="pyro">We're Almost Live!</span><br>
October 19, 2017</p>
<img class="ScreamFortress2" src="jungle_inferno_blog_notes.jpg">
<p class="ScreamFortress">As in: really reallllllly close. (Promise.)</p>
<p class="ScreamFortress">Typically we ship updates on a Thursday, so those of you expecting the Jungle Inferno<br>
Update to flip live today, you might want to sit down for this next part. If you're already in<br>
a comfortable sitting position, you might want to sit up straighter, because we're about to<br>
tell you we're delaying a day and we don't want you to twist your lumbar.</p>
<p class="ScreamFortress">We're delaying a day. The update's almost finished, but it's a pretty big one, and we<br>
 wanted another day to get everything ready and stress test it a little more. Our current<br>
plan is to release the update early tomorrow. Here's a big list of the changes, additions<br>
and fixes we'll be shipping tomorrow in the meantime.</p>
<p class="ScreamFortress"><span class="pyro">Hot Stuff!</span><br>
October 18, 2017</p>
<img class="ScreamFortress2" src="jungle_inferno_blog_pyro.jpg">
<p class="ScreamFortress">Can you smell the smoke in the air? If so, holy crap your house is on fire. Listen to us:<br>
Stop reading this update right now and call the fire department. Then come back, relax,<br>
and read about Pyro's new weapons while you're waiting for them to show up.
</p>

<p class="ScreamFortress">Jungle Inferno Update news can't be contained, much like the velociraptors in a movie<br>
we've been explicitly ordered not to mention. Or in the unrelated novel Jurassic Park,<br>
where the exact same thing happens, except no lawyers yell at whoever wrote the book<br>
version to stop stealing from Jurassic Park.
</p>
<p class="ScreamFortress">Why? Because nobody likes reading. And since these are boring reading words you're<br>
mouthing right now, let's get straight to the exciting video game parts.
